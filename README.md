# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project leverages a powerful Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the closing stock price of a company using historical data. Built with Python, Keras, and essential data science libraries, it provides a hands-on approach to time series forecasting in finance.

## 📚 Usage Instructions
1. Open the notebook: `Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_LSTM.ipynb`.
2. Change the stock ticker, start date, and end date in the data download cell to your desired company and time period.
3. Run all cells sequentially to train the model and generate predictions.
4. Visualize the results and review the model's performance.
